# The Wild Oasis


### Simple company app for employes to check in, check out, and book their guests on a server

This project uses supabase(an open source Firebase alternative) to make a server where we can store data, authenticate users, and so on. We use React Query to interact with the server.

With this we can implement features such as:

* Create, edit, copy and delete cabins

* Create, check in, check out and delete bookings

* Present the data in tables and charts

* Authenticate and create users

* Limit the access and data manipulation only for authenticated users

* Store images uploaded by users on the server

## Technology decisions:
* For starting the react app - Vite
* For styling - styled-components
* Error catching - eslint
* For icons - react-icons
* For routing - react-router-dom
* For UI state managment - Context API
* For remote state managment - React Query(@tanstack/react-query)
* For the server - Supabase (@supabase/supabase-js)
* For forms - react-hook-form
* For success/error pop-ups(toasts) - react-hot-toast
* For dates - date-fns
* For charts and graphs - recharts
